# GA Memdeck

This is a tool I have developed that can aid in adding a kicker ending to any of your tricks or give inspiration for creating your own.

The auto-generate tab will generate a set of shuffles and an order such that when those shuffles are applied they bring the deck back to new deck order. This tab was designed to give inspiration for coming up with your own tricks that somehow incorporate the shuffles. The custom shuffles tab allows you to put in your own shuffles and work out what order the deck should be in such that after those shuffles it returns to new deck order. This will allow any tricks you already have that have a consistant set of shuffles to now have a kicker ending of the whole deck returning to new deck order.
